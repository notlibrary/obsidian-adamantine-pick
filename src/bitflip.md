Adamantine diagram note about Landauer limit and meaning of nonsensical random bit flipping 
computer white noise It tells same old electrical engineering lore legend about counting 
parliament election votes in some small and very high developed european nation
So their memory chip capacitor cell hit with alpha particle from outer space(sic!) which charges 
cap and thus flips [ most significant bit + 5th(or other random index) ] in vote counter variable(or 
stack) inside computer program thus multiplying votes for some lucky unknown person 32 times
completely ignoring insignificant implementation details such as 
```pikchr
ALPHA_PARTICLE_VOTE: [

box "outer space" fit
down
box "ionosphere" fit
box "ozone layer" fit
box "concrete walls" fit
box "atx case" fit
box "mem chip package" fit
box " ++ capacitor bit cell ++ " fit

]

Border: box thin width ALPHA_PARTICLE_VOTE.width+0.1in height ALPHA_PARTICLE_VOTE.height+0.1in at ALPHA_PARTICLE_VOTE.center
Caption: text "ALPHA PARTICLE VOTER" mono with .n at 0.1cm below ALPHA_PARTICLE_VOTE.s
```
even  probability to hit this cell from billion others; other copies of variable; 2-complement;
endianess;  error correction codes; sysadmin hard reset and so forth

What if it's all just in your head? What's the minimum energy needed to flip the classic bit (not Q-
bit)? The minimal(infium) energy cost of `XOR 1` operation(or in C notation `i^=1;` ) What is the 
minimal physical system that theoretically support it? What's the actual energy cost to eliminate 
the single bit from the system? Rare important old constant it is also used in various debates 
concerning the Universe as numeric simulator It actual value varies from user definition
