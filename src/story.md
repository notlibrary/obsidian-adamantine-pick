Adamantine diagram note explaining plugin customized "(P)KM methodology" via user story
So you eventually find yourself surrounded with tons of useless city krank file information
overload(i.e. Obsidian Discord server or even worse Twitch chat with 100k users) 
without any single idea what to do next 

The 3-step algorithm as follows:
1. Get over it there's nothing you can do they all just pieces of paper flying away from you
2. Push finest extremely embeddable small vector graphics code in
3. (Optional) Start noticing pushing taking graphing short branded standardized pieces with highest estimated repickability/reusability value with it

```pikchr
GIVER: [
arrow "notice" above "push" below
file "short" "reusable" "standard"
arrow  <- "(re)pick" above "(re)use"
]
Border: box thin width GIVER.width+0.5in height GIVER.height+0.5in at GIVER.center
Caption: text "Take it" italic with .n at 0.1cm below GIVER.s 
Caption: text "RABBITHOLE" with .s at 0.1cm above GIVER.n 
```

Ironically the highest estimated repickability value short note in human history is probably
periodic table of elements and none of it elements exist in it's pure form in nature

Also the algorithm seems cool at the first glance avoid turning it into glass bead game 
Swiss army knife and offline Wikipedia dump then take care of yourself
and lazy overwatch what really happened with it if you will
On the other hand avoid being useless expensive jet airshow 
anyway it does vector calculus just for the lulz

In fact it doesn't even rely neither on the contents of user notes nor the daemonic nature
of continuous software note taking process operation which in turn only makes it even cooler
It somethat promotes situational awareness mental clarity and tactical thinking whatever it is

P.S. What's the difference between noticer giver taker picker and the graph? None
